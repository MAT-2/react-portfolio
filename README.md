# Description

This is a project that practices utilizing React to create a portfolio. It was fun being able to learn how each component connect with each other, while also being easy to main a fast rendering site. However, the only issue that I came across was deployment using Netlify, since there's an issue with displaying images, as well as my resume. There's a reoccurring issue with Netlify using Vite with configuring a website.
This does help me understand that not everything is perfect when it comes to deployment, and it is a great experience for me to understand how normal this must be when deploying any kind of website with a team.
